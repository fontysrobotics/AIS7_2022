# Assignment 2: (Deep) Neural Networks
This assignment will consist of Three parts (A, B and C)

* Part A will be about getting acquainted with a fully connected Neural Networks (NN), you will learn how to create a simple NN model for learning on relative simple datasets

* Part B will be about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), you will create and train a simple CNN model for learning on relative simple datasets

* Part C will be available soon

<!-- about analyzing deploying/using and re-training advanced Deep Neural Networks (architectures) that are designed and pre-traind by domain experts
-->

## Deliverables Assignment 2
At the end you have to hand in all the notebook of Assignment 2. When you hand it in you should make sure that you saved it with all output visible. So we can evaluate your notebooks output without directly running it. In addition (to be sure) you should also save a pdf of the final result.

We also want a short video which shows all the design steps (form collecting data/ training till deployment), in this video you should show and explain us what you did, which design choices you made and why for each part of the assignment.

#### Final deliverables Assignment 1:

* Notebooks Part A, Part B , Part C (saved after execution, so all outputs are visible)
* A pdf of these notebooks in the same state (as backup)
* A video explaining & showing the process and result of **Part A, Part B, Part C**
* The Assignment per group has to be <ins>**uploaded to Canvas before the given due date!**</ins>

| NOTE: Make sure you answer all questions that are given in all the notebooks and that you draw some conclusions/insights per execution step. Just showing the output is not sufficient.|
