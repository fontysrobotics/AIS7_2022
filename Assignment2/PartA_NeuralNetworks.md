# Assignment 2 - Part A

## Fully Connected Neural Network: MNIST dataset
---

In this part of the assignment you will implement your own fully connected neural network using [Keras](https://keras.io/).

Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. So it is a more accessible method of easily creating and using Neural Network architectures. Under the hood Keras uses [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), which is more complex in use.

## Tutorial

You are first going to build a Neural Network that is capable of classifying handwritten numbers. For this the [MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is used, here an example of some of the training data.

In the following video tutorial the basics of how to create/train/test a fully connected Neural Network and apply it to this database are explained to you.

In addition of this tutorial we want you to visualize the some of the outputs so they are more meaningfull/understandable. This is shown in the Tips & Tricks section

## Assignment

| Before you start the assignment make sure you followed the above tutorials. |
| ---|

In this Assignment you are going to classify images from a fashion dataset.

<!--
[Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

### Tasks

* Create a Jupyter notebook in where you build and train a fully connected Neural Network that can classify the fashion_mnist dataset.
  * Describe the implemented network architecture.
  * How many parameters does this network have, and where in the network are these located?
  * Visualize & explain the learning curves (loss, accuracy)
  * Explain what hyperparameters are available and what they do.
  * Which hyperparameter result in better training results?
  * What is the final accuracy of the trained Network?
  * In which way could the network accuracy be improved further (only explanation, no implementation)?
* The notebook should contain al code, outputs and answers to the given questions (so make sure we can find all needed info)
-->


You can find the jupyter notebook here. The notebook contains the assignment description!

> [Assignment2_PART_A.ipynb](Assignment2_PART_A.ipynb)

Follow the required steps described, place comments/conclusions/insights per step and answer the given questions in the Notebook.

## Hints

You can import the dataset directly from keras
```
fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

```
