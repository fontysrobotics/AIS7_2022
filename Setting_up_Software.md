# Software

For this course some software is required that you need to use/know and install.
First some of the used **Software packages** will be introduce and then the **Installation of the Software** is addressed.

---

## Software packages:

We will use Python during this course as programming language, in addition we will uses several software packages and tools.

### Python
Python is a general-purpose, versatile, and powerful programming language. Itâ€™s a great first language because Python code is concise and easy to read. Whatever you want to do, python can do it. From web development to machine learning to data science, Python is the language for you. https://www.python.org/

### Anaconda
Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. It also easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language. https://www.anaconda.com/

#### Conda vs Anaconda.Navigator

You can setup your environment with anaconda and you can always install additional packages that are required for your specific projects. You can do that over the command-line using conda, or you can use the GUI using Anaconda.Navigator.

### Jupyter notebook

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. https://jupyter.org/

#### Jupyter notebooks vs  Jupyter Labs

The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.
JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

### NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
https://numpy.org/

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. https://matplotlib.org/

### Pandas
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language. https://pandas.pydata.org/

### scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and many other utilities.

## Installation of the Software

For this course we will use Python and several specific Machine learning / Deep learning packages. for easy install we will use anaconda, which runs the conda package manager. This installation already installs a lot or required libraries and tools, but with this you also will be able to install additional machine learning packages later on.

### Desktop based (recommended):

You should download and install anaconda it from the following link.
https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Anaconda will install the conda package manager, but also the python environment and the jupyter environment we will use to run the notebooks on. Some base libraries will also be installed by default.

You can use the [install manuals](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) and [getting-started](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) guides from the anaconda website or follow this youtube tutorial (https://youtu.be/2WL-XTl2QYI})

### Cloud based:

You can also run some of the assignments on a (sometimes free) cloud service.  The advantage is that the main libraries are often already pre-installed and that the learning is done remotely on the cloud-service so is not depend on your hardware. The disadvantage is that some specific tools and libraries might not be available, or the service has another version installed which is not compatible with other packages that are required for these assignments.

examples of these cloud services are: Microsoft Azure Notebooks, Google Colaboratory, Kaggle Kernels, Amazon SageMaker.
