# Assignment 1

This assignment will consist of Two parts (A and B)

* Part A will be about getting acquainted with all tools / hardware / environments and deploying your first learning algorithms on relative simple datasets

* Part B will be about analyzing and deploying machine learning on more complex datasets as on your own generated dataset

Before you can start with the first assignment you should first setup your hardware, install the required software and follow some tutorials.

## Preparation


Read these documents first:
- [Background Information](Background_information.md) on used software.

<!--
- Make sure you assembled the hardware and installed the required software and connect to your Jetson -->

### Tutorials

We provide some tutorials how to get started with Machine Learning / use specific packages / import datasets / analyze data  / display results / implement and compare ML algorithms.
The knowledge learned from these tutorials will be required for making the Assignments.

Follow [These Tutorials](Tutorials/README.md) first before you continue!

### Hints

Additional info can be found in the [tips and trick document](Tips_and_Tricks.md)

## The Assignments


| Before you start the assignment make sure you followed the above tutorials. |
| --- |

### Assignment 1 - Part A


In Part A you will set-up the system and executed your first learning algorithm.
You can find a jupyter notebook here.
The notebook contains the assignment description!

> [Assignment1_PART_A.ipynb](Assignment1_PART_A.ipynb)

* Add your group number, names and code in the given notebooks
* Answer all questions that are located in the notebooks
* place your comments / conclusion / insights on all executed steps




### Assignment 1 - Part B

In part B you will analyze real data and generate a dataset for your own learning problem.
The assignment is split in 2 sections Part B1 and Part B2, in the first part you will use a given dataset that you need to analyze and train machine learning models on. In the second part you will generate your own dataset and you will have to train your models on that data.

> [Assignment1_partB.md](Assignment1_partB.md)

* Add your group number, names and code in the given notebooks
* Answer all questions that are located in the notebooks
* place your comments / conclusion / insights on all executed steps

## Deliverables

At the end you have to hand in all the notebook of Assignment 1. when you hand it in you should make sure that you saved it with all output visible (after execution), so we can evaluate your notebooks output without directly running it. In addition (to be sure) you should also save a pdf of the final result.

For assignment B2 we also want a short video which shows all the design steps (from collecting data till deployment), in this video you should **show and explain** what you did, which design choices you made and why!

***Final deliverables Assignment 1***:

* Notebooks Part A, Part B1, Part B2 (saved after execution, so all outputs are visible).
* A pdf of these notebooks in the same state (as backup).
* The data(sets) that you generated, so we can run your code if needed.
* A video (max 3 minutes) explaining & showing the process from dataset creation to final result of Part B2.

| NOTE: Make sure you answer all questions that are given in all the notebooks and that you draw some conclusions/insights per execution step. Just showing the output is not sufficient. |
