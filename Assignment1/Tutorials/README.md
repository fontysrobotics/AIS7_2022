# Tutorials:
We provide you with some torials and data files, which are located in this folder
In these tutorials you gain the required knowledge to work with sklear, pandas, etc and will enable you to be able to make the first assignment.

Note: that some instruction video's might refer to other file locations / installation of packages. But all required files for the tutorials are located here.


## 1st tutorial *   
> [iris-classification-random-forest.ipynb](iris-classification-random-forest.ipynb)

In the first tutorial you will be building a classification model for the Iris data set using the random forest algorithm. Although this already dives deep into the Machine learning topic, it are easy to follow steps

You will learns about jupyter notebooks, importing libraries and datasets, looking at your data, preprocessing your data for learning and deploying and evaluating your learned model.

## 2nd Tutorial *

> [comparing-classifiers.ipynb](comparing-classifiers.ipynb)

In this Jupyter notebook, we will be comparing the performance of different classifiers for building classification models.

You will create a dataset with random data, will see how you can visualize parts of your dataset, how to train on your data with multiple Machine learning algorithms and visualize the results.

Note that seaborne is not available on the Jetson, so results are plotted using mathplotlib or pandas.


## 3th Tutorial **

> [Project_Comparing_Machine_Learning_Algorithms.ipynb](Project_Comparing_Machine_Learning_Algorithms.ipynb)

This is a bigger tutorial, that uses a real dataset. Before you start visit the [website of the original tutorial](https://medium.com/@vaibhavpaliwal/comparing-machine-learning-algorithms-on-a-single-dataset-classification-46ffc5d3f278).
Here a lot of detailed background information / explanation is given

You will import a dataset, learn how to visualize the raw data, analyze this data to see if there are correlations between features, visualize the results in a correlation matrix, train on the data and generate a confusion matrix
