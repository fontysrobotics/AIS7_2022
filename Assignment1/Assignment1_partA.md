# Assignment 1 part A

## Wine Dataset

In this assignment you will import and explore/analyze a Wine dataset for classification. You will explore which ML algorithms are best to classify this and you will present your best solution. You already worked your way through a few tutorials and her you can integrate your learned knowledge

In the next assignment we will use a larger real-world dataset, but for this assignment you will use the Wine dataset that is on of the smaller classification datasets  that are implemented in sklearn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html

These are the generic steps to be taken

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Explore the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms
5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones.
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
9. Additional Questions

In the Notebook this structure is used for dividing the different steps, so make sure you do the implementation and analisis at these location in the notebook.

You may add additinal code blocks, but keep the seperation of the given structure.
At the end of each block summarize / comment / conclude your current step in the given textblocks.

You have to hand in this notebook together with the notebook of part B, and Part C when you hand it in you should make sure that you saved it with all output visible. So we can evaluate your notebooks output without directly ruinning it. In addition (to be sure) you should also save a pdf of the final result.


You can find the jupyter notebook here. The notebook contains the assignment description!

Follow the required steps described, place comments/conclusions/insights per step and answer the given questions in the Notebook.
